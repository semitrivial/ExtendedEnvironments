If you are familiar with how python environments work, you can vary these
instructions (using a different environment system than conda, etc.)

Otherwise, these instructions assume you have conda installed.
(We used miniconda version 4.10.3 but any recent version *should* work.)

1. Create a new conda environment named "ExtendedRLExperiment" set to include
    python version 3.6 (we did the experiments with python 3.6.13 but any
    recent version of python 3.6 should work):

conda create -n ExtendedRLExperiment python=3.6

2. Activate the environment

conda activate ExtendedRLExperiment

3. Install Stable Baselines3.

pip install stable-baselines3==1.1.0

4. Install extended-rl. Go to the ExtendedEnvironments directory (the
    directory two levels above this file, where setup.py is located), and type:

pip install -e .

You should now have the prerequisites installed which are necessary to run the experiment.
Instructions for running the experiment are in ExampleMeasurements.py.
