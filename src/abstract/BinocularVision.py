# Take a 3d game and two camera functions and output an extended environment
# designed to incentivize binocular vision.
# -------------
# Inputs:
#   Game3D: a function which outputs 3d models as a function of actionsequences.
#     A 3d model is, e.g., a 100x100x100 matrix of 1s and 0s, representing the 3d
#     world in front of the player.
#     An actionsequence is a sequence of actions taken by the player.
#   LeftCamera: a function which takes a 3d model and outputs a 2d bitmap of
#     what the player's left eye sees of that 3d model
#   RightCamera: like LeftCamera but for the player's right eye
# -------------
# Output:
# An extended environment where the agent is shown the pairs of 2d bitmaps
# given by LeftCamera/RightCamera, and is rewarded for acting exactly as if it
# had instead been shown the underlying 3d bitmaps (and is punished otherwise).
